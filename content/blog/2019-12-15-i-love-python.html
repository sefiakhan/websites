<p>This semester I learned about Python for the first time. I always believed that Python was a coding language far too complexed for me to learn. Learning python in my computational biology course changed this perception for me. With more practice in Python I realized it is not much different from R studio. The same datasets can be used and the same functions can be carried out in both prgorams. The connections between the two made learning Python easier than I thought it would be. There are many examples that show how R studio is really similar to Python. For example, you can use python to perform the same calculations of variance, mean, median, or standard deviation.</p>
<p>np.std(faithful.eruptions)
np.var(faithful.waiting)</p>
<p>Perhaps a little more interesting is the fact that making plots in Python is much easier compared to R studio. The code below shows how easy making a scatter plot is.</p>
<p>plt.scatter(faithful.waiting, faithful.eruptions)</p>
<p>Another way that the two programs are similar is the fact that both can tidy data. The following code is used in R:</p>
<p>df %&gt;% select(x,y,z) %&gt;% head(3)</p>
<p>The same result from this code can be produced from the Python code below.</p>
<p>df[[‘x’,‘y’,‘z’]].head()</p>
