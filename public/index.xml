      <description>This semester I learned about Python for the first time. I always believed that Python was a coding language far too complexed for me to learn. Learning python in my computational biology course changed this perception for me. With more practice in Python I realized it is not much different from R studio. The same datasets can be used and the same functions can be carried out in both prgorams.</description>

      <description>Sefia Khan (sk46882) The datasets I chose were New York City SAT results in 2012 and AP Exam results in 2010. The SAT dataset contains the average student score for each of the SAT sections (critical reading, writing, and math). It also includes the school name and DBN. DBN is a unique identifier that shows the disctrict, borough, and number for each school. The other variable in this dataset is the number of SAT test takers for each school.</description>
